The very first thing that I noticed is that it is organized well and the design of it is very good.
The only thing I would have changed on the design of the main form is making it wider so that all/most of the data could be seen at once because only half of the columns are visible
From what I noticed, there was no issues with the code and nothing seemed to break it
The code compiles without any warnings or issues
The programs design is understandable and very user-friendly
Everything is organized in group boxes which is very good at making it more user friendly as well as aesthetically pleasing
The code is organized very well and does not have any dead code (not that I have noticed)
There is a very good amount of comments and each part of the code can be easily understood with those comments.
I think that I prefer this program over mine. Mine was somewhat similar, with the groups and radio buttons, and even the background color, but this program is a bit better and it also has a search box.
^^I also tested out the search box and I found it to be pretty cool. I like how you can choose what column you want to search from
Besides making the main form a bit wider to display more data from the database, I think that everything else is great! The code and the design are not lacking and it is easy to understand how he got certain things to work the way it did.
